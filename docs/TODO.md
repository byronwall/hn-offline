# TODO

## Conversion to SolidJS

- [ ] Share icon on stories does not get proper meta data?
- [ ] Recompute the color map when the story data updates

## For later

- [ ] Update the saved story list when a new item is loaded - ensure content is alway the latest - will also need to override sorting
- [ ] Figure out how to handle icons better (if desired) - get a library or pass props correctly
