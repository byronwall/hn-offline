# TODO

## Conversion to SolidJS

- [ ] Add a trap to show client data if available if server does not respond
- [ ] Sort out service worker and better integrate into vite
- [ ] Reimplement the virtual rendering for comments
- [ ] Get the Docker builds working again
- [ ] Deploy to server and verify all is working
- [ ] Figure out how to handle icons better (if desired) - get a library or pass props correctly
- [ ] Get the link interceptor working again
- [ ] Update the saved story list when a new item is loaded - ensure content is alway the latest - will also need to override sorting
