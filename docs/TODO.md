# TODO

## Conversion to SolidJS

- [ ] Sort out service worker and better integrate into vite
- [ ] Reimplement the virtual rendering for comments
- [ ] Get the Docker builds working again
- [ ] Deploy to server and verify all is working
- [ ] Consider deferring client rendering until all local state stuff is processed
- [ ] Figure out how to handle icons better (if desired)
- [ ] Loading a story page from server should update local storage - avoid bump on re-nav
