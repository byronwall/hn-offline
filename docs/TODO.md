- [ ] Sort out service worker and better integrate into vite
- [ ] Reimplement the virtual rendering for comments
- [ ] Figure out how to handle icons better (if desired)
- [ ] Get the Docker builds working again
- [ ] Deploy to server and verify all is working
- [ ] Resolve errors with Show HN and collapsing the title comment
