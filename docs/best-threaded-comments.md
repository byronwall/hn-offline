# The Best Threaded Comment Reader I’ve Ever Used

Reading dense, branching discussions is usually exhausting. Threads collapse in confusing ways, colors blur together, and it’s easy to lose your place. This threaded comment reader fixes that with a few carefully engineered ideas: fast click-to-collapse, per-author color coding that avoids collisions, deferred rendering so the DOM stays snappy, and a horizontal “reply bar” that makes conversation flow visible as you scroll. It even auto-scrolls to the next relevant comment and briefly flashes the collapsed one so you keep your bearings.

## Click to collapse: body or left margin

You can collapse or expand any comment simply by clicking the comment body (links are respected and won’t toggle), or the left margin. This single affordance dramatically reduces friction when skimming.

Under the hood, each comment is a `bp3-card` with a click handler that toggles open/closed and records the state in a persisted store. The store keeps a lightweight map of collapsed comment IDs so your choices stick around.

## Unique author colors that avoid collisions

Every author gets a distinct color, with special treatment for the story author, who appears in Hacker News orange. Colors are chosen with spacing logic to minimize clashes: the algorithm takes into account a chain of parent hues, recent sibling hues, and terminal child hues to maximize perceptual separation where it matters most.

- **Story author**: fixed HN orange.
- **Other authors**: assigned via a hue-spacing strategy that picks colors in the largest gaps between recent hues.
- **Rendering**: the color is applied to the comment’s left border and to a horizontal reply bar (more on that below), making identity and thread continuity immediately visible.

## Deferred rendering keeps scrolling fast

Deep threads can mean thousands of nodes. Instead of rendering everything at once, the list streams in as you approach, using an IntersectionObserver-driven “pump.” As the sentinel at the bottom of the visible list intersects the viewport, a small batch of additional comments is rendered, keeping time-to-interaction low and the DOM lean.

- **Batching**: a tiny batch size yields smooth, continuous loading.
- **Sentinel padding**: root margins ensure the next batch is prepared before you arrive.
- **Resilience**: if you collapse or expand, the pump re-evaluates and resumes as needed.

## Horizontal reply bars make conversation flow obvious

A subtle but powerful cue: whenever a reply chain continues from an earlier author in the current thread context, a colored horizontal bar appears, aligning with that author’s color. It’s position: sticky, so as you scroll, the bar stays visible just long enough to show the continuation path before gracefully yielding.

This solves a classic readability problem: nested replies can visually disconnect from their referents. The bar acts like a conversation timeline, connecting who is responding to whom.

## Smart auto-scroll with orientation flash

When you collapse a comment, the reader automatically scrolls to the next relevant comment, respecting the current hierarchy and which items are open. On expansion, it scrolls the current item into a comfortable viewport offset. To ensure you never lose context, the collapsed item briefly flashes with its author’s color, giving a subtle, non-intrusive orientation cue.

- **Close behavior**: finds the next visible sibling (or the next logical parent) after DOM updates finalize.
- **Open behavior**: smooth-scrolls the target into view with a pleasant offset.
- **Orientation**: a brief CSS animation flashes the collapsed card using the author’s color.

## Why this feels better

- **Less cognitive load**: colors convey identity at a glance; the sticky bar clarifies reply paths; orientation flash prevents getting lost.
- **Faster navigation**: single-click collapse/expand anywhere you expect, plus smart auto-scroll.
- **Performance at scale**: deferred rendering keeps the DOM light without sacrificing continuity.

## Implementation highlights (for the curious)

- **Click-to-collapse**: comment cards toggle open/closed with a single handler; anchor clicks are exempt so links behave normally. Collapsed state is persisted so your reading session is stable across reloads.
- **Color assignment**: the story author is fixed to HN orange; other authors receive hues chosen to avoid recent and ancestral collisions, then converted to display colors.
- **Deferred rendering**: an IntersectionObserver watches a sentinel and schedules incremental rendering on animation frames for buttery smoothness.
- **Sticky thread bars**: computed per-comment using author ancestry and comment depth, then positioned and sized for clear continuity signals.
- **Auto-scroll + flash**: next-target calculation respects collapse state and DOM timing; a CSS animation uses a per-card `--flash-color` to guide the eye.

If you care about actually understanding long discussions, these details add up to a reader that feels effortless. It lets you scan, dive, and resurface without losing the thread—literally.
